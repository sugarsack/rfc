# Implementation

## Detailed Design

Detailed design how the feature is going to be implemented.

### Terminology definition

New terminology should be defined here.

### Explanation

- Corner-cases specifics.


## Usage Example

Describe how to use your feature or solution.

# Implications

- Implementation cost (code size, complexity and change depth)
- Integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- Migration costs

## Backwards Compatibility Issues

Either none, or describe which.

## Security Impact

Either none, or describe what potentially might happen.

## Adoption Process

If this gets implemented:

- How existing users will adopt it?
