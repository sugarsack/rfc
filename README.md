# RFC for Sugarsack

A collection of design RFCs related to Sugar Project.

# Process

## Apply

It is very simple:

1. Copy `template.md` into a reasonable name inside `proposed` directory, e.g. `my-great-feature.md`.
2. Fill it in, following the template.
3. Open a Pull Request to this repo with your new Great Feature TM.
4. Announce it on the mailing list.
5. Give it a bit of time to think about it. It should be _at least_ a good week, as long as enough people are aware of it.

## Accept (or not)

- If there is no voting or no reactions to this, then this RFC could be just not needed. :wink:
- If there are more `-1` than `+1` — bad luck.
- If there are more `+1` than `-1` — consider to be a leader :crown: of this feature and start implementing it. Feel free to work together with someone.

## Wrap Up

All the history of the voting and acceptance/rejection is going to be there in the RFC. Further similar ideas will be redirected to your RFC for at least awareness of it.

# FAQ

**Q: Is there are general BDFL of the entire project who can kill my RFC, regardless?**

A: No and never will be. You are BDFL of _your own_ feature. Cherish it, make a best out of it!

**Q: I designed so great, but nobody wants it.**

A: `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` That's the life. But try again, "sell" it better. Maybe nobody just understands it, or maybe you should consider arguments and "rephrase" it better? In any case, try again.

**Q: What is the criteria to be accepted or rejected?**

A: Whoever does most work probably has more "weight" in the voice. So if you want to be like a Hulk here, absolutely go ahead with your ideas and PRs (bugfixes, tests, RFC implementations etc)!
